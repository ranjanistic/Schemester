Android application focused on time table schedule.

## Contribution Guidelines
Create your own branch from master to contribute in any way. Directly commiting and pushing changes to branch-master isn't recommended and your commits might get reverted. It is safe to create own branch and then contribute.

### Try not to:
```
- Editing instances of Firebase
...
    FirebaseUser user = FirebaseUser.getInstance()
    //instances and objects of Firebase in code to be managed by the owner of database project.
...
- Remove existing gradle dependencies
...
    implementation "xyz.abcd-1.2.3"
    //dependencies may be appended but not to be edited
...
```
